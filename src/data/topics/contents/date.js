    memoryModel: `### **Time in Memory**

**1. Object Storage:**
- A Date is an object in the **Heap**.
- Internally, it holds a single **primitive number** (the 64-bit timestamp).

**2. Immutability:**
- Date objects are **mutable**. If you use \`setFullYear()\`, the object itself changes in memory.
- **Rule:** For safe logic, always create a copy of a date (\`new Date(oldDate)\`) before modifying it.

**3. Engine Precision:**
- Although Dates use milliseconds, modern CPUs and browser engines can provide microsecond-precision timing via \`performance.now()\`.
- Standard Dates are tied to the **System Clock** in RAM, while \`performance.now()\` is tied to the **Hardware High-Resolution Timer**.`,
