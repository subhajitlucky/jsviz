    syntax: `// 1. Synchronous (Block Stack)
console.log("Start");

// 2. Asynchronous (Move to Web API -> Task Queue)

    memoryModel: `### **The Architecture**

**1. Call Stack (The Brain):**
- Where your code is executed line-by-line. 
- Lives in fast **RAM**.

**2. Web APIs (The Workers):**
- Provided by the browser (not JS itself). 
- Handle timers, network requests, and DOM events in separate threads.

**3. Task Queue (The Waiting Room):**
- Where callbacks wait after the Web API finishes.
- The **Event Loop** constantly checks: \"Is the Stack empty? If yes, push the first task from the queue to the stack.\"

**4. CPU Impact:**
- A blocked Event Loop causes 100% **CPU usage** on a single core, making the entire browser tab unresponsive (the \"spinning wheel of death\").`,
