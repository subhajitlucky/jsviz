    memoryModel: `### **Protection Mechanisms**

**1. Immutable Buffers:**
- When an object is frozen, the engine marks its memory block as **Read-Only** in the **Heap**.
- Any write attempt triggers a trap that immediately stops the operation (and throws in Strict Mode).

**2. Slot Protection:**
- The engine can hide specific **Internal Slots** (like [[Prototype]]) from being accessed via standard string keys, preventing easy pollution.

**3. Execution Realms:**
- For maximum security, untrusted scripts should be run in a separate **Realm** (like a Worker or Sandboxed Iframe) so they cannot touch the Main Thread's **Global Object**.`,
