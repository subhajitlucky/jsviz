    memoryModel: `### **Allocation & Linking**

**1. The 'prototype' Property:**
- Every function has a \`.prototype\` object created automatically in the **Heap**.
- This object holds the shared methods for all instances created by that constructor.

**2. Instance Linking:**
- When \`new\` is called, the engine allocates space in the **Heap** for the new instance.
- It adds a hidden **[[Prototype]]** pointer from the instance back to the constructor's \`prototype\` object.

**3. Reference Overhead:**
- Instance properties (e.g., \`this.name\`) are stored **on the object** in memory.
- Prototype methods are stored **externally** and accessed via a pointer.
- **Hardware:** This approach balances fast access (for local properties) with low memory usage (for shared methods).`,
